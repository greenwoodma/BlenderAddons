# Blender Addons: A Random Collection

The repository contains a small number of Blender addons I've written and is organized
into folders that mirror the Blender addon categories.

## Development Practices
To conform with standard Blender best practices the files should be PEP8-80 compliant.
You can test that they are using
```
python3 -m flake8 <addon.py>
```
If you don't have `flake7` installed you can get it by running the command
```
python3 -m pip install flake8
```
