# Blender Addons: A Random Collection

The repository contains a small number of [Blender](https://www.blender.org) addons I've written and is organized
into folders that mirror the set of Blender [addon categories](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Addons/Guidelines/metainfo#category).

## Development Practices
To conform with standard Blender best practices the files should be PEP8-80 compliant.
You can test that they are using [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org)
```
python3 -m flake8 <addon.py>
```
If you don't have `flake7` installed you can get it by running the command
```
python3 -m pip install flake8
```
